# 3n Sort of Schnorr and Shamir


The 3n Sort of Schnorr and Shamir is an algorithm for sorting on a two-dimensional arrays.
The 3n sort decomposes the two-dimensional array into vertical slices, horizontal slices, and blocks.
It uses the unshuffle operation, a permutation that corresponds to dealing $n$ cards to $k$ players, to sort the elements.


## Computational Cost

The computational cost of 3n sort of Schnorr and Shamir is $\mathcal{O}{\left(n^{\frac{3}{4}}\right)}$.
More precisely, the computational cost is ${3 n} + \mathcal{O}{\left(n^{\frac{3}{4}}\right)}$.
