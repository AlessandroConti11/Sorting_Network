# Rotatesort


The rotatesort is an algorithm for sorting on a two-dimensional arrays.
The rotatesort is a sorting network based on cyclic rotations of a sequence. 
It works by applying rotations to the sequence, ensuring that the elements are sorted by making systematic comparisons and rotations.
The rotatesort algorithm is based on three operations: balance, unblock and shear.


## Computational Cost

The computational cost of rotatesort is $\mathcal{O}{\left(n\right)}$.
More precisely, the computational cost of rotatesort requires at most ${10 n} + \mathcal{O}{\left(\sqrt{n}\right)}$ elementary steps.
