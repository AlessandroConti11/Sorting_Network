# 2D Odd-Even Transposition Sort


The 2D Odd-Even Transposition Sort is the simplest algorithm for sorting two-dimensional arrays.
The idea of [odd-even transposition sort](../odd-even_transposition_sort/README.md) is generalized to two-dimensional arrays in a straightforward way.
The elements are not just compared with their right and left neighbours, but also with their upper and lower neighbours. 


## Computational Cost

The computational cost in the worst case is $\Theta{\left(n^2\right)}$, similar to the one-dimensional version, but adapted for the two-dimensional structure.
